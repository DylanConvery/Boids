# Proposal
The goal of this project is to give an immersive 2D woodland experience.I plan to
try capture what it’s like to explore the woods. What this means technically is 
that the user will be able to explore a procedurally generated grass and woodland,
including the birds, mushrooms and random flora and fauna. 

I plan to take some inspiration from the likes of the old school Pokemon games
suchas Red, Gold, and Ruby. As well as that I’ll also be drawing from Stardew 
Valleyand its woodland parts of the town. Another game I similar to this feel
would be Minecraft. The project will be built using the Unity Game Engine.
