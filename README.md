Student Number: D14124700

Class Group: DT228/TU856

# Description

This project will implemented a well known flocking simulation called Boids using the Unity Game 
Engine and procedural generation. Boids or bird-oid objects, was first developed by Computer 
Scientist Craig Reynolds in 1986. 

# Instructions for use

The simulation starts itself. The flock follow a predetermined route. Sit back and enjoy.

# How it works

Each indivdual agent is governed by three rules that determine their overall flight and direction.

- Cohesion: Steer towards the average position of other boids
- Seperation: Steer clear of other boids to avoid collisions.
- Alignment: Steer towards the average direction of the boid.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

Implementing this algorithm was challenging at the best of times. I'm most proud
that I managed to do it and for it to come out so well. I never realised the 
potential it had until now. I'm now seeing boid simulations everywhere.

# Proposal

The goal of this project is to create an interesting simulation using procedural
generation. Birds flocking can be awe inspiring but also intimidating at times
due to the sheer size they can grow to. 

There are plenty of examples of flocking implemented in video games throughout
the years from The Legend of Zelda, to Horizon Zero Dawn, to Uncharted. Bird
Flocking is found under water when viewing fish. The same behaviour can be 
observed. That's why I want to try implement this behaviour. The possiblities
and use cases are endless.
