# What I am most proud of in the assignment

# Proposal submitted earlier can go here:
The goal of this project is to give an immersive 2D woodland experience.I plan to
try capture what it’s like to explore the woods. What this means technically is 
that the user will be able to explore a procedurally generated grass and woodland,
including the birds, mushrooms and random flora and fauna. I plan to take some 
inspiration from the likes of the old school Pokemon games suchas Red, Gold, and 
Ruby. As well as that I’ll also be drawing from Stardew Valleyand its woodland 
parts of the town. Another game I similar to this feel would be Minecraft. The 
project will be built using the Unity Game Engine.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
